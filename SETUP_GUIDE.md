# TikTok Developer API Test Project - Setup Guide

## Summary: Is Your Code Sufficient?

**YES**, your code structure is correct and should work for pulling user data and video data from TikTok's API. However, the scope authorization errors you're experiencing are likely due to **TikTok Developer Portal configuration**, not your code.

## Why You're Getting "User Did Not Authorize Scope" Errors

### 1. **TikTok Developer Portal Configuration**
   
Even if users check all scopes in your UI, those scopes must be **approved in your TikTok Developer Portal**. Here's what to check:

#### Go to: https://developers.tiktok.com/

1. **Login** to your TikTok for Developers account
2. Navigate to **"Manage Apps"** â†’ Select your app (`sbawjjtuzyd0z5u7fv`)
3. Go to **"Add Products"** or **"Permissions"** section
4. **Request these scopes** if not already approved:
   - âœ… `user.info.basic` - Basic profile info (name, avatar)
   - âœ… `user.info.profile` - Extended profile (bio, region, gender, signup time)
   - âœ… `user.info.stats` - User statistics (followers, following, likes, video count)
   - âœ… `video.list` - Access user's video list

5. **Submit for review** if required (some scopes need TikTok approval)
6. Check your app's **status** - it may need to be "Live" or "In Production"

### 2. **Scope vs API Field Mismatch**

Your `callback.html` requests many fields that require specific scopes:

| API Field | Required Scope |
|-----------|---------------|
| `display_name`, `avatar_url`, `open_id` | `user.info.basic` |
| `bio_description`, `region`, `gender`, `signup_time`, `profile_deep_link` | `user.info.profile` |
| `follower_count`, `following_count`, `likes_count`, `video_count` | `user.info.stats` |
| Video list endpoint | `video.list` |

**If any required scope is missing or not approved, the API call will fail.**

### 3. **User Authorization**

Even with approved scopes in the Developer Portal, users must:
- See the permission request during TikTok login
- Actually grant those permissions
- Not have previously denied those permissions

## Testing Checklist

To successfully test your app:

- [ ] All 4 scopes are **requested** in your TikTok Developer Portal app settings
- [ ] All 4 scopes are **approved** (check approval status)
- [ ] Your app is in the correct environment (Development/Production)
- [ ] The redirect URI in Developer Portal matches: `https://kennethmyrwjy.github.io/callback.html`
- [ ] When testing, select ALL checkboxes on the login page
- [ ] During TikTok OAuth, grant ALL requested permissions
- [ ] Use a TikTok account that has videos (for video.list testing)

## What I've Updated in Your Code

I've improved your error handling to make scope issues clearer:

1. **Better error messages** - Now shows specific TikTok API errors
2. **Clearer scope descriptions** - Added labels to explain what each scope does
3. **Default scope selection** - All scopes now checked by default for easier testing
4. **Graceful degradation** - Shows "N/A" for missing fields instead of breaking

## Common TikTok API Issues

### Issue: "Invalid scope"
- **Cause**: Scope not approved in Developer Portal
- **Fix**: Request scope approval in TikTok Developer Portal

### Issue: "Access token invalid"
- **Cause**: Token expired or scopes changed
- **Fix**: Re-authenticate with fresh token

### Issue: "No videos found"
- **Cause**: 
  - User has no videos OR
  - `video.list` scope not granted OR
  - Videos are private
- **Fix**: Test with an account that has public videos

### Issue: Some profile fields show "N/A"
- **Cause**: Missing required scope for those fields
- **Fix**: Ensure all scopes are checked and approved

## Next Steps

1. **Check TikTok Developer Portal** - Verify all scopes are approved
2. **Test with all scopes selected** - Use the updated UI with all checkboxes
3. **Check browser console** - Look for specific API error messages
4. **Test with different accounts** - Try accounts with/without videos

## Security Note

You mentioned this is a test project, so security isn't a concern. However, for production:

- **Never expose `CLIENT_SECRET` in frontend code** (use a backend server)
- **Validate state parameter** to prevent CSRF attacks
- **Use HTTPS** (which GitHub Pages already provides)
- **Store tokens securely** (not in localStorage for production)

## Need More Help?

If errors persist:
1. Check the browser **Console** (F12 â†’ Console tab) for API responses
2. Look at **Network** tab (F12 â†’ Network) to see exact API errors
3. Share the specific error message from TikTok's API response

Your code structure is solid - the issue is almost certainly with TikTok Developer Portal scope configuration! ðŸŽ¯
