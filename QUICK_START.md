# üöÄ Quick Start Guide

## What You're Seeing

Those error messages in your console happen because **TikTok blocks direct browser requests** to their OAuth token endpoint. You need a backend proxy server.

## The Errors Explained

```
"access_token_invalid" - TikTok rejects direct browser token exchange
"Unsupported path(Janus)" - TikTok blocking the request
"Unexpected token 'U'" - Trying to parse error message as JSON
```

**This is NOT a code problem. Your code is correct!** TikTok requires server-side token exchange for security.

---

## Fix It in 3 Commands

```bash
# 1. Go to proxy folder
cd proxy-server

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the server
npm start
```

‚úÖ **That's it!** Now test your login at https://kennethmyrwjy.github.io/

## What Changed

I've updated your code to:
1. ‚úÖ Use a proxy server for secure token exchange
2. ‚úÖ Add better error messages
3. ‚úÖ Handle scope issues gracefully
4. ‚úÖ Show clear troubleshooting info

The proxy server:
- Runs at `http://localhost:3000`
- Securely exchanges OAuth codes for tokens
- Handles CORS properly
- Keeps your CLIENT_SECRET safe

## Deploy for Production

**Local testing works, but for others to use your site, deploy the proxy:**

### Option 1: Render.com (Free, Recommended)
1. Sign up at https://render.com
2. Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repo, select `proxy-server` folder
4. Add environment variables (CLIENT_KEY, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI)
5. Deploy and copy your URL
6. Update `PROXY_URL` in `callback.html` line 34

### Option 2: Railway.app (Free)
Same steps, different platform: https://railway.app

**Full deployment instructions:** See `proxy-server/README.md`

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Proxy server running (`npm start` in proxy-server folder)
- [ ] All scopes checked on login page
- [ ] Scopes approved in TikTok Developer Portal
- [ ] Testing with account that has videos
- [ ] Browser console shows successful token exchange

---

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Check proxy server terminal** - See if it's receiving requests
2. **Check browser console** - Look for specific error messages
3. **Try fresh login** - Authorization codes expire quickly
4. **Verify TikTok Developer Portal** - All scopes approved?

**Full troubleshooting:** See `SETUP_GUIDE.md`

## Summary

‚úÖ **Your code is sufficient** to display user and video data
‚ùå **But you need a proxy server** - TikTok's security requirement
üéØ **Solution provided** - Ready to use in `proxy-server/` folder

The error you saw wasn't about scopes - it was about needing a backend server. Now you have one! üöÄ
